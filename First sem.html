<h2>RATIONALE </h2>
Contents of this course provide fundamental base for understanding elementary mathematics and their uses 
in solving engineering problems. Contents of this course will enable students to use basic mathematical 
function like logarithms, partial fractions, matrices and basic 2D, curves in solving various engineering 
problems of all fields. 
<h2>LEARNING OUTCOMES </h2>
After undergoing this course, the students will be able to: <br><br><ul>
<li> apply Binomial theorem to solve engineering problems </li>
<li>apply determinants properties and Crammerâ€™s rule to solve engineering problems </li>
<li> apply dot & cross product of vectors to find the solution of engineering problems </li>
<li>use complex numbers in various engineering problems</li>
<li>apply differential calculus and higher order to solve engineering problems </li>
<li>find velocity, acceleration, errors and approximation in engineering problems with application of 
derivatives.</li></ul> </h2>
