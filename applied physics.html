 <h2>INSTRUCTIONAL STATREGY </h2>
Teacher may use various teaching aids like live models, charts, graphs and experimental kits etc. for 
imparting effective instructions in the subject. The teacher should explain about field applications before 
teaching the basics to develop proper understanding of the physical phenomenon. Use of demonstration
