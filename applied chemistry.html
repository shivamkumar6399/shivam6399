				<h1>APPLIED CHEMISTRY</h1>
				<h2>RATIONALE </h2><p>
The use of various chemicals and chemical products in diverse technical and engineering fields have 
repeatedly proved the importance of Applied Chemistry, which enhances its role to a new peak. On the 
other hand, ever increasing use of such materials will compel engineers, technocrats to acquire essential 
applied chemistry knowledge in order to select engineering materials, which not only suit them but also 
provide more environmental compatibility. This situation demands principles of Applied Chemistry in 
diploma-engineering courses. Principles of Applied Chemistry will enable budding engineers and 
technocrats to develop scientific temper and appreciate physical, chemical and engineering properties of 
materials. Hence the subject of Applied Chemistry. </p>
