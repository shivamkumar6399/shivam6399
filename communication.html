<h2> process of communication.</h2>
<b>Difination</b>The process of communication refers to the transmission or passage of information or message from the sender through a selected channel to the receiver overcoming barriers that affect its pace. ... Communication process consists of certain steps where each step constitutes the essential of an effective communication
<p><h2><b>Effective communication process</b></h2>The process of communication refers to the transmission or passage of information or message from the sender through a selected channel to the receiver overcoming barriers that affect its pace.<br><br>

The process of communication is a cyclic one as it begins with the sender and ends with the sender in the form of feedback. It takes place upward, downward and laterally throughout the organization.<br><br>

The process of communication as such must be a continuous and dynamic interaction, both affecting and being affected by many variables.<br><br>

Communication process consists of certain steps where each step constitutes the essential of an effective communication.

The following is a brief analysis of the important steps of the process of communication.<br><br>

<h2>The Different Elements in The Process of Communication</h2>

We will now learn about the different elements in the process of communication.<br>

<b>Sender</b><br>

The very foundation of communication process is laid by the person who transmits or sends the message. He is the sender of the message which may be a thought, idea, a picture, symbol, report or an order and postures and gestures, even a momentary smile. The sender is therefore the initiator of the message that need to be transmitted. After having generated the idea, information etc. the sender encodes it in such a manner that can be well-understood by the receiver.

<br><b>Message</b><br><br>

Message is referred to as the information conveyed by words as in speech and write-ups, signs, pictures or symbols depending upon the situation and the nature and importance of information desired to be sent. Message is the heart of communication. It is the content the sender wants to covey to the receiver. It can be verbal both written and spoken; or non-verbal i.e. pictorial or symbolic, etc.

<br><b>Encoding</b><br>

Encoding is putting the targeted message into appropriate medium which may be verbal or non-verbal depending upon the situation, time, space and nature of the message to be sent. The sender puts the message into a series of symbols, pictures or words which will be communicated to the intended receiver. Encoding is an important step in the communication process as wrong and inappropriate encoding may defeat the true intent of the communication process.

<br><b>Channel</b><br>

Channel(s) refers to the way or mode the message flows or is transmitted through. The message is transmitted over a channel that links the sender with the receiver. The message may be oral or written and it may be transmitted through a memorandum, a computer, telephone, cell phone, apps or televisions.<img src="/storage/emulated/0/Website/communication_process-removebg-preview.png" alt="communication" class="img">
<h2>Types of Communication : Formal, Informal, Interpersonal, Non-verbal Communication

</h2><p>Communication can be characterized as Formal, Informal, Inter-personal and Non-verbal communication: </p>
<h3>formal communication</h3>
Formal communication means the communication which travels through the formally established channels. In other words, communication which travels through the formal chain of command or lines of hierarchy of authority is called the formal communication. Under it, information is given through the formally designed channel or network. It is designed, controlled and regulated by the management. <img src="/storage/emulated/0/Website/types_of_communication-removebg-preview.png" alt="" class="img">
<h2>Informal communication</h2>
Informal communication refers to the communication which takes place on the basis of informal relations between the members of a group. It is personal communication in nature and not a positional communication. It does not flow along with the formal lines of authority or formal chain of command. Even it is not regulated by the formal rules and procedures. Normally, members of informal group use this form of communication in order to share their ideas, views, opinions and other information. There is lack of official instruction for communication. It is not controlled and designed by formal organizational structure. So, it is not used to communicate formal message.
<h2><u>Advantages of Informal Communication</u></h2><ul><li>It is more flexible.</li>
<li>It helps to improve decision-making.</li><li>Informal communication is faster in speed than formal communication.</li>
<li>It works as a powerful and effective tool of communication.</li>

<li>It may provide feedback to managers on their actions and decisions.</li>
</ul>
<h2><u>Disadvantages of Informal Communication</u></h2>
<ul><li>It is difficult to fix responsibility for the information.</li>
<li>It may cause misunderstanding.</li>
<li>It carries inaccurate, half-truth or distorted information.</li>
<li>It is difficult to believe on information.</li>
<li>It leads to leakage of secret information.</li>

</ul>
</p>
<h2>Inter parsional communication</h2>is the process of exchange of information, ideas and feelings between two or more people through verbal or non-verbal methods. It often includes face-to-face exchange of information, in a form of voice, facial expressions, body language and gestures.
<h2>Orl communication (face-to-facep)</h2><p>Oral communication that takes place face-to-face is regarded as most common and recognized type of communication. When the individuals are communicating with each other face-to-face, they aim that through words, they are able to express directly to others. This communication can be formal as well as informal. The individuals communicate face-to-face within the organizations with other members and outside the organizations, it takes place with family members,friends, relatives, community members etc.<img src="/storage/emulated/0/Website/Ftf.png" alt="error" class="img"> In face-to-face oral communication, there are various factors, which need to be taken into account. These include, maintaining eye contact, keep the tone and expressions decent, they need to suit the message that needs to be conveyed, one should not depict any negative feelings such as, anger and frustration and develop confidence. When the individuals are delivering lectures, speeches and presentations, they need to be confident and not depict any kind of vulnerability and apprehensiveness. When these factors are put into operation, the individuals are able to hone their oral communication skills, when communicating face-to-face. 
 </p><h2>Orl communication (distance)</h2><p>
	Oral communication can take place among the individuals in an appropriate manner, when they are located at a distance. This communication is common and is an integral part of the lives of the individuals. In communicating orally with individuals, who are located at a distance, there are number of methods and technologies, which are utilized. These include, mobile phones, VOIP, video-conferencing, 2-way webinars and so forth. These are regarded as modern and innovative methods, through which oral communication can be promoted among individuals, when they are located at a distance. <img src="/storage/emulated/0/Website/Dis1.png" alt="error" class="img">In the effective implementation of this type of communication, tone of voice and pace of delivery are regarded as crucial. The important factors that need to be taken into account in promoting oral communication at a distance are, listening, speaking slowly, reiterating the information that is understood and keeping the tone of voice open and receptive. In some cases, when the individuals are unable to understand the concepts and other information clearly through oral communication, they may ask to send them through email. </p>
	<h2>written communication </h2><p>Written communication is the type of communication that takes place in a written form. The common forms of written communication are letters, notices, emails, messages, advertisements and so forth. When the information is lengthy and comprise of images, pictures, charts, graphs, statistical data and so forth, then it cannot be imparted orally to the individuals. In such cases, written communication is regarded as one of the indispensable ways of imparting information. When the <img src="" alt="">individuals are to send documents and reports, then they simply get them scanned and send them through email. When the individuals are communicating with each other in a written form, they need to take into account various factors, these include, addressing appropriately, making use of decent words, stating the information in a clear and understandable manner, stating all the necessary concepts and concluding well by saying thank you and putting the name and signatures. In order to implement written communication in an effective manner, it is vital for the individuals to up-grade their skills in terms of various forms of technologies. When they are well-equipped in terms of usage of computers, lap-tops, I pads and mobile technologies, they will be able to carry out written communication satisfactorily. </p>
	<h2>non verbal communication</h2><p>Non-Verbal Type of Communication
	Non-verbal type of communication is more subtle. It takes place in the daily lives of the individuals as well as within organizational structures. In the implementation of this form of communication, there are number of factors that need to be taken into consideration. These include facial expressions, gestures, body language, eye contact, touch, space and the personality of the individuals. In this type of communication, there are three important features, which need to be identified. These are, what is said with words, what is shared with postures and gestures and the feelings of the individuals influence the messages and information that is imparted. The non-verbal information cues, the way one looks, listens, moves and reacts convey to the individuals that one is communicating with whether or not they are concerned. Furthermore, it is vital for the individuals to impart truthful information. <div><img src="/storage/emulated/0/Website/Nb2.png" alt="error"class="img"><img src="/storage/emulated/0/Website/Nb.png" alt="error"class="img"></div>The five roles of non-verbal communication are, repetition, contradiction, substitution, complementing and accenting (Nonverbal Communication, 2019). In order to bring about improvements in non-verbal type of communication, one of the significant aspects is, the individuals need to curb the psychological problems of anger, stress, frustration, depression and anxiety. Furthermore, they need to form a constructive approach and possess an approachable nature. When the individuals are able to augment these factors, they are able to enhance non-verbal types of communication. </p><p><h2>	Grapevine Communication</h2>
	Grapevine is regarded as the form of informal communication. It takes place both in the internal as well as external informal channels, which lead to effective functioning and benefit of the organization. Research has indicated that in various types of organizations, the individuals do not follow any systematic process of communication, but it takes place among individuals without following any prescribed or predetermined rules. Through the grapevine, information flows in different directions, establishing connections between various aspects of the organization. This type of communication is governed by social and personal relationships, rather than any recognized rules and formalities.<div><img src="/storage/emulated/0/Website/Gc.png" alt="error"class="img"><img src="/storage/emulated/0/Website/Gc2.png" alt="error"class="img"></div> Grapevine operates in internal and external informal channels. Through this form of communication, the individuals pass rumours, opinions and suspicions that generally do not move through formal channels. Pleasant and amiable environmental conditions within the organizations are essential in developing the sense of belongingness among the individuals. In this manner, they are able to work in collaboration with each other, obtain support and assistance and incur the feeling of job satisfaction. Within organizations, there are number of situations, issues and concerns, regardless of their size and nature. The presence of grapevine is more a product of the situation than it is to the person (Grapevine Communication, 2017). </p>
	<p>	<h2>Feedback Communication</h2>
	When the individuals, who are in leadership positions in educational institutions and in various forms of organizations, such as, instructors, supervisors, heads, directors, employers and so forth, put into operation various types of assessment methods to evaluate the performance of the individuals. After evaluating the performance, they provide them feedback in terms of their performance. Hence, the communication that takes place is termed as feedback communication. The main objective of feedback communication is to make provision of support and assistance to the individuals to overcome the limitations and bring about improvements. In the implementation of feedback communication in an efficient manner, these individuals need to take into account various factors, these include, inculcating the traits of morality and ethics, being honest and truthful, following the standards and principles and giving constructive criticism. When the individuals experience set-backs in their performance, then limitations need to be identified in a constructive manner. Furthermore, the individuals, in leadership positions need to make provision of help, support and assistance to their students and employees to identify the inconsistencies and bring about improvements. Therefore, within educational institutions at all levels and various types of organizations, this type of communication is regarded as crucial and beneficial. </p>
	<h2>communication barriers</h2>
	Barriers of Communication: This far we have seen what we mean by the process of communication. But, at times even after taking care of every other detail some misunderstandings arise. So, to eliminate these misunderstandings, we have to understand the most common barriers to effective communication. Let us see what these Barriers of Communication are!<h2>Barriers To Effective Communication

</h2><ul>
					<li>Dissatisfaction or Disinterest With One's Job. ...

</li>
<li>Inability to Listen to Others. ..

</li>
<li>Lack of Transparency & Trust. ..

</li>
<li>Communication Styles (when they differ) ...

</li>
<li>Conflicts in the Workplace. ...

</li>
<li>Cultural Differences & Language.

</li>
	</ul>
	<h2><u> Communication barriers How to overcome them</u></h2>
	<p>Effective communication is significant in the workplace, family, and dealing with friends. Communication is vital to not only exceed information and facts but to build and strengthen relationships. Communication should be brief and straightforward to communicate ideas, feelings, thoughts, and emotions in a clear and understandable manner. Barriers to successful communication can ruthlessly impact and even harm relationships. So, below we have mentioned what communication barriers are and how to overcome them effectively.</p>
	<h2>What are communication barriers</h2><p>Communication barrier are something that prevents us from correctly getting and accepting the messages others use to communicate their information, thoughts and ideas. Some of the examples of communication barriers are information overload, choosy perceptions, workplace gossips, semantics, gender differences etc.</p><h3><ul><li>Psychological Barriers</li></ul></h3><p>The psychological condition of the receiver will power how the message is received. Stress management is a significant personal skill that affects our interpersonal relationships. For example, Anger is a psychological barrier to communication. When we are angry, it is simple to say things that we may afterwards regret and also to misunderstand what others are saying. Also, people with low self-esteem may be less self-assured and therefore may not feel comfortable communicating.</p>
	<h3><ul><li>Pysical Barriers</li></ul></h3><p>Communication is usually easier over shorter distances as more communication channels are obtainable, and less technology is obligatory. Although modern technology often serves to decrease the crash of physical barriers, the advantages and disadvantages of each communication channel should be unspoken so that a suitable channel can be used to overcome the physical barriers.</p>
	<h3><ul><li>Language Barriers</li></ul></h3><p>Language and linguistic aptitude may act as a barrier to communication. However, even when communicating in a similar language, the terms used in a message may act as a barrier if it is not easy to understand by the receiver.</p>
	<h3><ul><li>Attitudinal Barriers</li></ul></h3><p>Attitudinal barriers are perceptions that stop people from communicating well. Attitudinal barriers to communication may effect from poor management, personality conflicts, and battle to change, or a lack of motivation. Active receivers of messages should challenge to overcome their attitudinal barriers to assist effective communication.</p>
	<h2>How to overcome those Communication Barriers</h2>
	<h3><ul><li>We eware of language massage & tune:</li></ul></h3><p>The sender should ensure that the message should be structured in clear and simple language. The tone of the message should not harm the feelings of the receiver. As far as possible, the contents of the message should be a concise and unnecessary use of technical words should be avoided.</p>
	<h3><ul><li>consult other  communication:

</li></ul></h3>
<p>When you’re planning the communication, suggestions should be invited from all the individuals concerned. Its main benefit will be that all those people who are consulted at the time of preparing the communication preparation will add to the success of the communication system.</p>
<h3><ul><li>Communicate according to the need of receiver:

</li></ul></h3><p>The sender of the communication should organize the formation of the message not according to his or her level, but he or she should keep in mind the point of understanding or the surroundings of the receiver.</p>
<h3><ul><li>Consistency of Message</li></ul></h3><p>The message sent to the receiver should not be self- opposing. It should be in unity with the objectives, programmes, policies and techniques of the organization. When new information has to be sent inlay of the old one, it should always make a declaration of the change; otherwise, it can raise some doubts and queries for the same.</p>
<h3><ul><li>Make sure to receive proper feedback</li></ul></h3><p>The reason for feedback is to find out whether the receiver has appropriately understood the meaning of the information received. In face-to-face communication, the reply of the receiver can be understood. But in the case of written communication or other forms of communications, some correct process of feedback should be adopted by the sender</p>
<h3><ul><li>conclusion</li></ul></h3><p>Communication is way essential, that makes the moving parts of human relations function smoothly. Therefore, the meaning of communication cannot and should not be underestimated.</p>
<h2>what are you barriers to communication</h2><div="div2"><img src="/storage/emulated/0/Website/B.png" alt="error" style="width:280px;height:100px;"></div><p>Anything that hinders clear and efficient channels of communication can be considered a barrier.<br>There are so many barriers, and they can change based on any given situation or working environment. We've noted some of the most common issues below.</p><h2>barriers to communication and how to spot them</h2>
<h3>1 language</h3><p>
You’ll find that language may be the barrier if you use a lot of complicated technical terms, buzzwords, or colloquial terms. It's also something to consider if you're communicating in a language that is not your first language, or to others who are not fluent in your language.</p>
<h3>Emotion</h3><p>
If you’re too worked up about what you’re trying to communicate, it can be difficult to get your message across. Likewise, fear or uncertainty on your part can instil doubt in those you are communicating to.</p>
<h3>Interpersonal

</h3><p>
Being unable to establish a connection and rapport with others can inhibit your ability to communicate.</p>
<h3>cultural</h3><p>

<h2>Application of grammar</h2>


</p>
<h2>Part of speech</h2>We can categorize English words into 9 basic types called "parts of speech" or "word classes". It's quite important to recognize parts of speech. This helps you to analyze sentences and understand them. It also helps you to construct good sentences.<img src="/storage/emulated/0/Website/POS.png" alt="error"class="img">

<h1>Wriring Skill</h1>
<h2>picture composition</h2><p>The picture composition is usually divided into three patterns where a student is asked to describe a picture given or make a story out of it or to express and elaborate upon the thoughts and feelings suggested by the given picture. The picture can be a photograph, an action scene, a quote written over a picture or a scene or a sketch of a famous personality. The composition is written in three different forms so as to highlight this uniqueness.</p>
<h2>Example</h2><p>Study the picture given below. Write a story or a description or an account of what it suggests you. Your composition may be about the subject of the picture or you may take suggestions from it; however, there must be a clear connection between the picture and your composition.
<img src="/storage/emulated/0/Website/Pic.png" alt="error"style="height:213px;width:284px;">
<b>Answer</b>The picture shows three schoolgirls playing a game of cricket instead of being at school. It shows that, just like boys,
girls can also skip school and play games during the time when they should be at school. They are shown in the picture as carrying their school bags as backpacks. So it appears that they had got ready for school and left their homes for attending school. But then, why did these girls skip school?<br>From the dress worn by the girls in the picture, it appears they are living in either a rural area or in a small town and they are enrolled in a government school. It is well-known that three-quarters of India’s schools are operated by the government, but nearly half of these schools don’t have separate usable toilet facilities for girl students. The situation is relatively better in private schools. Consequently, many girls either skip classes or drop out from school altogether. Many of them avoid eating breakfast at home before going to school, so that they don’t need to use a toilet during school time. Due to this, theyfeel sleepy during the class, thus faring poorly in tests. Thus, their aspirations bring girls to schools, but lack of toilets drives them awaySeparate toilets for girls are highly inadequate in schools and are definitely one of the reasons for dropping out. But more than anything else, it is a dignity issue and an issue of security for girl students. Going outdoors to answer nature’s call poses a serious threat to the dignity of these girls. In addition, for older girls who are menstruating, the issue of menstrual health comes up. But schools often fail to recognise this or are unable to do anything due to lack of funds. So, even those who don’t actually drop out, end up missing school for almost a week every month. Further, when a girl does not go to school, there is constant pressure on her parents to marry her off, thus causing a child marriage. Consequently we end up having an uneducated girl who is a child bride and unable to face the world on her own. The government must wake up and take strong steps to redress this wrong against half of our population.

<b>qustion2</b><p>Study the picture given below and write a story or a description or an account of what it suggests you. Your composition may be about the subject of the picture or you may take suggestions from it; however, there must be a clear connection between the picture and your composition.
<div class="con"><img src="/storage/emulated/0/Website/Ip.png" alt="error"style="height:213px;width:284px;"></div><b>Answer</b><br><br><br>School is perhaps one of the best experiences of life. This makes me recall an incident of my life. An excursion was planned by my school when I was in the 9th standard. The news came as a surprise to me and we were too excited to go. We were informed that we were going to Jaipur for two nights and three days.
<br>When I went home, I very cautiously told this to my mother who did not stir a bit. I had to try very hard to convince her. Finally, she gave her consent and advised me not to do anything reckless on my trip.<br>Once we were in Jaipur, we visited beautiful forts there. We also saw peacocks there. We could not stop ourselves from admiring their beauty. As we were about to click some pictures of the peacocks, we heard some school kids screaming. The noise was so loud that we moved towards the direction from where screams were coming. To our surprise, we saw three of our school children sitting on an elephant along with the master of the elephant. That was not the usual scene of an elephant ride because the animal was crossing the lake with all these four people sitting on it. The lake surrounded the fort and was deep. The water was also quite cold that day and so the elephant was slightly uncomfortable crossing the lake.<br>
The elephant was losing its balance and this was the reason that the kids were screaming. Everybody present there was only looking at the helpless kids as even the elephant’s master was unable to control the balance of his animal. Although the kids were holding each other but still they seemed to be afraid. Suddenly, the elephant lost its balance and to everyone’s surprise all its passengers fell in the water.<br>
All the children started yelling for help. I and my friends knew swimming and we jumped into the lake for their rescue. By God’s grace, we were successful in saving their lives. On coming back from the trip, we were praised by our school Principal and were also awarded with the bravery award. Our parents felt so proud of us.r
